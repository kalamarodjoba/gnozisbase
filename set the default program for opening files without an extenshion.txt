set the default program for opening files without an extenshion

assoc .="No Extension"
ftype "No Extension"="C:\path\to\my editor.exe" "%1"

Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.

To give credit, I learned this from the vim wikia here and here

Extra info:

Instead of "C:\path\to\...", the following macros may be useful:

%SystemDrive% - drive windows is installed on, i.e. C:\
%ProgramFiles% - e.g. "C:\Program Files\"
%ProgramFiles(x86)% - e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\"
You will need to properly escape them though:

ftype "No Extension"=^"^%ProgramFiles(x86)^%\Notepad++\notepad++.exe^" "%1"
